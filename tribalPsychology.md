# Tribal Psychology

Henri Tajfel - Social identity theory

Social identity is the portion of an individual's self-concept derived from perceived membership in a relevant social group. 

When we define ourselves, we do so in large part by asserting loyalty to the groups to which we belong

The amount of differentiation needed for humans to start seeing themselves as part of a group is surprisingly small, and we can enter into "us vs them" mode in just about a few seconds.

The more intense the conflict is, the more intense you think of your competitor as an 'out-group' member -- instead of as an individual.

The more your identity is tied up with your group, the more you start seeing out-members as inferior.

### Tajfel experiments

Tajfel was Jewish and grow up in Poland. He became fascinated with the question of "How one group could hate another group so much that perpetuating genocide could become reasonable". Studying prejudice and conflicts throughout the 50s and the assumption was that war-like animosity originated from rational root causes such as: 
* Aggressive leadership personalities arising to power
* Grievances over a historic conflict
* Social inequalities leading to misaligned values

Tajfel was skeptical. He thought that the differences that people claimed to be the source of their hatred seemed arbitrary, without consistency, rooted in meaningless categorical differences not thoughtfully ideological differences.

If we removed all major social differences between two groups, and we would add a small meaningless difference, what animosity rise up?

ANY noticeable difference of any kind will reliably stimulate the group of behaviours that flows from tribal psychology, leading to prejudice and discrimination.

Group splitting will inevitably arise from any differences in clothing, opinions or physical aspects. This is called the minimum group paradigm. Humans will not only form groups spontaneously, they will form over anything. No matter how arbitrary or meaningless the split difference is.

**We have a biological need for both inclusion and exclusion. We need to feel that we are part of something, but we also need to feel that not everyone can be part of the group I am in, otherwise, my group wouldn't have any value.**

### Social media as a propeller to those group signaling

Political polarization is less about political disagreements and more about group signaling. Since we tend to form tribes very easily over arbitrary things, and since we don't usually think of these differences in tribes as a byproduct of our irrationality but as a rational decision based on facts, what is happening is that more and more issues are leaving the realm of evidence and compromising debate to the realm of tribal signaling and team dispute. And once one issue becomes politicized, it leaves the realm of fact and figures to become one of the heart.

At the end of the day, it is possible for two people to not disagree on almost anything, but still perceive each other as an enemy to be dealt with. The desire to be a good member of your tribe becomes much heavier than the desire to be correct.

* Depoimento de Moro

Politicians are constantly lying about things voters can verify with a simple google search, and still, they simply do not care enough to. 

## Facts will not save the world - information deficit model

This idea that facts alone can convince people is a very old misconception. Benjamin Franklin believed that public libraries would make the common man as educated as the aristocracy and thus empower the public to vote in their best interests. The internet made people believe that with information in the palm of everyone's hand we would not be liable to lies. The dream would be of a future in which we would all have access to the same facts, therefore we would all agree with the same solutions.

In studies of the public understanding of science, the information deficit model (or simply deficit model) or science literacy/knowledge deficit model attributes public skepticism or hostility to science and technology to a lack of understanding, resulting from a lack of information. It is associated with a division between experts who have the knowledge and non-experts who do not. The model implies that communication should focus on improving the transfer of information from experts to non-experts.

It stems from the fact that anyone who reads the things that you have read or sees the things that you have seen will interpret them in the same way that you had.

The truth is that we have always been motivated reasoners, interpreting facts in the best way it meets our needs and goals. And despite what one can me yourself believe, we are not always motivated by such a loft goal as the truth, but much more by being part of our tribe or group. Even more so when we do not work with truth itself like in journalism.

But, why would one be more motivated by tribal loyalty than by being correct?
When you disagree with the group agenda, the group starts to access if you have the right values or if they can still trust you. We increase the risk of expulsion from the group. It's an underlying group pressure to signal in favor of the group's cannon beliefs.

The better you are at numbers, the better you are at manipulating it to protect your politically motivated beliefs. *CONVIDAR CARLOS GOES*

The evidence is clear that humans value being a good and prominent member of their much more than they value being correct. Will choose to be wrong (although we believe we are right) if it keeps us in good standing with our peers.

We are unaware of how unaware we are. And yet, we proceed with confidence in the false assumption that we are fully aware of the source of our thought and opinions. But most of the time, the true source of our thoughts and opinions is based on invisible primal instincts like the fear of not being accepted by our peers. Not one of us enjoys believing that most of our choices and values are based on irrational behaviours, but for many issues, that's exactly what is happening.
