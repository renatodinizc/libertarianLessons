# Arc One - Why leadership

### Naive Realism
The tendency to believe that the other side is wrong because they are misinformed, that if they knew what you knew, they would change their minds to match yours.

### The mass man
If there is such an entity as the "masses", there must exist a singular primitive entity such as the "mass man".
[...] and with that argument, I hereby make my argument that each trying of "educating the masses" of liberalism will inevitably fail before our eyes because there is no such thing as these so-called "masses" to work upon. So, what's left for us?

 - Here I can talk about a range of different cognitive biases. See the first module.

### Influential opinion
What I wish to suggest here is the futility of attempting to build on a foundation that does not exist. One might as well look for an abundance of flowers where seeds have been scarce. The out-front folks in political parties are but thermometers, only indicators of the political temperature. Change the temperature and there will be a change in what’s out front spontaneously. The only purpose of keeping an eye on the thermometer is to know what the temperature is. If the underlying influential opinion — the temperature — is interventionist, we’ll have interventionists in public office.

It’s the influential opinion that counts, and nothing else. This is to be distinguished from “public opinion,” there being no such thing. Every significant movement in history — good or bad — has resulted from influential ideas held by comparatively few persons. The rest of us are followers, including the out-front political personalities.

### Attractive exposition vs imposing exposition
We have learned that ideas cannot be "crammed down the throat" of another. Experience makes it plain that such attempts arouse only hostility. No one, however, resents taking a look at the ideas of another, regardless of the disagreement, providing the ideas accurately reflect the author's genuine convictions.

- Pluralistic ignorance

### Self-flourishing as an end in itself toward freedom
All individuals are faced with the problem of whom to improve, themselves or others. Those who don’t even try or, when trying, find self-improving too difficult, usually seek to expend their energy on others. Their energy has to find some target. Those who succeed in directing their energy inward become moral leaders. Those who fail to direct their energy inward and let it manifest itself externally become immoral leaders.

The true end of Man is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent whole. Freedom is the first and indispensable condition that the possibility of such a development presupposes, but there is besides another essential — intimately connected with freedom.

 - Limits of state action by Wilhelm von Humboldt

### Freedom and responsibility
For some, the word "freedom" conjures up images of “anything goes,” of disorder, chaos, immorality, and license. Unsurprisingly, they consider freedom frightening. As a consequence, many have believed that order and virtue must be imposed at the expense of freedom.

We deserve to be free because we can be held accountable for our acts; because we can make choices; because we can exercise self-control. Responsibility is not a burden we must bear to be free. Responsibility is the key to the realization of freedom.
