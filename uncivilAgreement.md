# Uncivil Agreement

Studying political polarization, one of the things that strike me is how the public debate is framed on the idea that divergent opinions lead to hate between different political groups. The polarization would be the culmination of years of debate without respect for different opinions, empathy with different experiences, and with excess fervor toward radical political personalities. 

However, taking an in-depth look at political polarization shows a strangely different picture. Groups do not have to disagree to hate each other. As a matter of fact, different groups can hate each other without actually disagreeing on issues dear to them.

### Politics is based on identity

Each and every one of us has a multitude of social identities, based on the things we like, the sports we practice, the places we visited, the communities we were born in, and so on. As human beings, our identities affect the way we process information and relate to order people in the world. No one is immune to this effect and accepting these phenomena is the first step to handling it better.

When we try to define who we are, groups enter as a means to it. Political groups in this sense are a full plate since they package a lot of aspects.

### Conformity to rules

You don't need to conform to rules if they pertain to another group.

### Issue based VS Identity-based polarization

People are more identified with their political labels than with their positions on determining issues. That's why we constantly see people on both sides arguing against factual evidence about a policy that promotes what they supposedly care about, just because it was not an original proposition from their political group.
