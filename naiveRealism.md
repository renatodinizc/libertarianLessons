# Naive Realism

- Start with a (preferably comic) questioning of the likes: why everyone is always wrong?

### False consensus effect - Lee Ross

In psychology, the false consensus effect, also known as consensus bias, is a pervasive cognitive bias that causes people to “see their own behavioral choices and judgments as relatively common and appropriate to existing circumstances”. In other words, they assume that their personal choices, beliefs, and actions are the widespread norm through the general population — the "obvious choice" or the "common sense".

"We overestimate the extent other people see the world the way we do. We do not make allowance that other people have been through different experiences, different communities, and that leads then to resolve ambiguities in different ways than us. That, ultimately leads then to respond in different ways than we imagine were possible."

This is a natural phenomenon that occurs to each and everyone of us which we do never ever realize is driving our opinions about the people who disagree with us.

**You probably think of yourself as liberal as is reasonable. You weigh between rationality and emotions and juggle between arguments and counter-arguments to model your worldview. Meanwhile, others to your left of the political spectrum are too idealistic and others to your right are too callous. You are in the sweet spot, where you see yourself as reasonable and rational one can be without giving up on empathy and sympathy toward others.**

**The ones with more progressive opinions than you are naive, crazy, maybe delusional, or simply don't have any respect for traditions and culture. Meanwhile, those that share a more conservative mindset than you are too close-minded, laggers, maybe selfish, or simply lovers of a legacy past.**

And thing is that this is as natural as it can be for humans. If you thought of yourself as less idealistic as one should be, you would already be on the pursuit of this more idealistic view. On the other hand if you felt that you were acting more conservative than one should, you would already be on the pursuit of a more progressive leaning course of action.

In sum, we make inaccurate assumptions that lead to inaccurate predictions of how other people will think and behave. And then, when we are confronted with reality of how they actually behave, we proceed to make inaccurate judgments about their actions.

### Bias VS Enlightenment

We are capable of recognizing that the way we think about the world is influenced by our experiences, the community we grew with, even by the local culture with are immersed in. The issue arises when we think that all that is a source sole enlightenment, it makes us really understand how the the world really are. But in the case of other people, with different experiences, distinct background and other culture we reason that they are understandably biased by those same sources, inducing then on their way of thinking and acting. We may even grant that if we were of their shoes we could be reasoning like then, but that doesn't mean that we think we would be right, just that we would be subject to those same biased visions they already are. We think that everything that hits us and changes the way we think and act are sources of knowledge, doses of an obscure reality that grant us with a more accurate model of the world as it is, meanwhile glaring the views of others, making then susceptible to confusion and misinterpreting the world as is.

At the end of the day, the ones who agree with you must be enlighten by their experiences, meanwhile the ones who doesn't must be polluted by their own experiences.

## Naive realism

Naive realism would be the credo that we observe the world objectively, in a unmediated way. What we see in the world is actually the world, without any interference whatsoever from outside. So we expect that other people share our views and beliefs about that same world. And since the world is one, whom do we disagree are actually in fault with reality. Since they are not lunatics (well some of them actually are), there must be a reason for that difference in perspective. It must reside into their experiences and how it inadvertently disrupts how they perceive reality (in a non-enlighten way of course).

We can even admit that we can sometimes change our views, but at the end of the day, we maintain that NOW we see reality in a objectively way, and prior to that change we may saw it in a biased way.
