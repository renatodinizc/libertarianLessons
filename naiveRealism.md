# Naive Realism

- Start with a (preferably comic) questioning of the likes: why everyone is always wrong?

### Rede Globo

Because people tend to think of their own take on events not as a “take” but as a veridical assessment of what is taking place, anyone who tries to offer an even-handed account of events will tend to be seen as biased and hostile to the perceiver’s interests.

Political groups tend to think that networks which flatter to the other side of the  political spectrum as blatantly dishonest, whereas they see networks that shares their perspective as a source of refreshingly clear thinking.

### False consensus effect - Lee Ross

In psychology, the false consensus effect, also known as consensus bias, is a pervasive cognitive bias that causes people to “see their own behavioral choices and judgments as relatively common and appropriate to existing circumstances”. In other words, they assume that their personal choices, beliefs, and actions are the widespread norm among the general population — the "obvious choice" or the "common sense".

We overestimate the extent other people see the world the way we do. We do not make allowance that other people have been through different experiences, different communities, and that leads them to resolve ambiguities in different ways than us. That ultimately leads them to respond in different ways than we imagine were possible.

### The sandwich experiment
In a vivid illustration of this phenomenon, Lee and his colleagues asked student volunteers to walk around campus wearing a large sandwich-board sign bearing a message (e.g., “Eat at Joe’s”) and to note the reaction of people they encountered. The students, however, were given the opportunity to decline the invitation to participate if they wished (and return for a later study instead). Immediately after agreeing or refusing to participate, the students were asked to estimate the frequency of agreement on the part of other participants and to make inferences about the personal attributes of someone who would accept the experimenter’s invitation and someone who would refuse it.
As predicted, the consensus estimates and trait inferences were very different for the two types of participants. Those who agreed to wear the sign estimated agreement to be more common than refusal and less revealing of the person’s personal attributes. Those who refused to wear it thought that refusal would be more common than agreement and assumed that agreeing to wear the sign said more about a person’s personality.

When sizing up the responses of their peers, people often fail to take into account the possibility that their peers may be responding to a very different set of “facts” and “circumstances.

This is a natural phenomenon that occurs to each one of us which we never realize is driving our opinions about the people who disagree with us.

**You probably think of yourself as liberal as is reasonable. You weigh between rationality and emotions and juggle between arguments and counter-arguments to model your worldview. Meanwhile, others to your left of the political spectrum are too idealistic and others to your right are too callous. You are in the sweet spot, where you see yourself as reasonable and rational one can be without giving up on empathy and sympathy toward others.**

**The ones with more progressive opinions than you are naive, crazy, maybe delusional, or simply don't have any respect for traditions and culture. Meanwhile, those that share a more conservative mindset than you are too close-minded, laggers, maybe selfish, or simply lovers of a legacy past.**

And the thing is that this is as natural as it can be for humans. If you thought of yourself as less idealistic than one should be, you would already be in pursuit of this more idealistic view. On the other hand, if you felt that you were acting more conservatively than you should, you would already be on track to a more progressive-leaning course of action.

In sum, we make inaccurate assumptions that lead to inaccurate predictions of how other people will think and behave. And then, when we are confronted with the reality of how they actually behave, we proceed to make inaccurate judgments about their actions.

### See fundamental attribution error
The error is in seeing someone's actions as solely reflective of their personality rather than somewhat reflective of it and also largely prompted by circumstances. It involves a type of circular reasoning in which the answer to the question "why would they do that" is only "because they would do that."

As an example of the behavior which attribution error theory seeks to explain, consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is cut off in traffic by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his fundamental personality, e.g., he thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is a jerk, he is an unskilled driver; she does not think it is situational, e.g., he is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school. Alice might well make the opposite mistake and excuse herself by saying she was influenced by situational causes, e.g., I am late for my job interview, I must pick up my son for his dental appointment, rather than thinking she has a character flaw, e.g., I am such a jerk, I treat others with contempt, I am bad at driving.[2]

### Bias VS Enlightenment

We are capable of recognizing that the way we think about the world is influenced by our experiences, the community we grew up with, and even the local culture in which we are immersed. The issue arises when we think that all that is enlightenment, it just makes us understand how the world really is. But in the case of other people, with different experiences, distinct backgrounds, and other cultures we reason that they are understandably biased by those same sources, inducing them in their way of thinking and acting. We may even grant that if we were in their shoes we could be reasoning like them, but that doesn't mean that we think we would be right, just that we would be subject to those same biased visions they already are. We think that everything that hits us and changes the way we think and act are sources of knowledge, doses of an obscure reality that grant us a more accurate model of the world as it is, meanwhile glaring the views of others, making them susceptible to confusion and misinterpreting the world as is.

At the end of the day, the ones who agree with you must be enlightened by their experiences, meanwhile the ones who don't must be polluted by their own experiences.

## Naive realism

Naive realism would be the credo that we observe the world objectively, in an unmediated way. What we see in the world is actually the world, without any interference whatsoever from outside. So we expect that other people share our views and beliefs about that same world. And since the world is one, who we disagree with is actually at fault with reality. Since they are not lunatics (well some of them are), there must be a reason for that difference in perspective. It must reside in their experiences and how it inadvertently disrupts how they perceive reality (in a non-enlighten way of course).

We can even admit that we ourselves can sometimes change views, but at the end of the day, we maintain that only now do we see reality in an objectively way, and prior to that change we may see it in a biased, or at least inaccurately way. We prefer to think that we from five to ten years ago were stupid and now we are wise than to fancy that we had already an accurate view of the world, but now we simply have appended new experiences onto our lives.

We fall into an illusion that Daniel Gilbert call's "End of History", in which individuals of all ages believe that they have experienced significant personal growth and changes in taste up to the present moment, but will not substantially grow into different tastes in the future. Despite recognizing that their perceptions have evolved, individuals predict that their perceptions will remain roughly the same.

*Add blind spot bias references*

## If only we could expose others to my facts...

The assumption is that as long as they are rational if you expose those people to the same collection of facts that you have been exposed to, they are supposed to think just like you. If after the exposition the other person agrees with you than she is reasonable. And when we try that and it doesn't work, we become frustrated and the only choice that's left for us is to believe that the other is been non-rational or unreasonable about the issue in dispute.
